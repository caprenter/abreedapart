## Update the 'message' section

This is in the `index.md` file at https://github.com/caprenter/abreedapart/

Change the line that says (something like): 
```
  open-today-message: "Closed until Monday"
``` 
If you don't want to show that section at all just leave it as

```
  open-today-message:
``` 

## Gallery

The gallery works by showing the last uploaded picture first, and moving the rest along one.

### Add/Remove/Change photos

Go to https://github.com/caprenter/abreedapart/tree/main/assets/images/gallery

#### Add

Use the `Add File` dropdown menu. Select `Upload file`

#### Remove

Click on the file you want to remove - this will take you to a new page
Delete it using the rubbish bin icon

#### Change

You can't really just change a photo, you need to delete it and add a new one.
